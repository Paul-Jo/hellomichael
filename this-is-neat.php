                  <p>With the trend of the "uber of" company becoming more ubiquitous, the question remains, is there still room for the small business? <a target="_blank" href="https://www.thisisneat.com.au">This is Neat</a> is striving to answer that very question (and maybe prove some doubters wrong) by competing with the rise of Australian "on-demand" cleaning companies.</p>

                  <p>Living in Sydney, I had the pleasure of moving from Surry Hills to Newtown. In doing so, I was surprised by two very interesting Australianisms. First, it's the norm for rental properties to be managed by real estate agents and second, that they would prefer you use a professional <a target="_blank" href="https://www.thisisneat.com.au">end of lease cleaning service</a> when moving out. As it turns out, an entire industry of cleaning exists to mediate this tug of war between tenant and real estate agent.</p>

                  <p>With This is Neat, I've had the opportunity to help a small business by designing and developing the strategies behind their online presence. Now they can focus on what they do best, helping tenants get their bonds back with the perfect clean.</p>

                  <p>It's been said before, but there's no substitute for first-hand experience. To really understand the client, I ditched the keyboard and put on a pair of gloves. Working beside the cleaners, it became evident that the largest problem they faced was in communication. Often customers were getting their first end of lease cleans, not knowing quite what to expect.</p>

                  <p>From the checklists to the checkout, the copy to the quote form, the focus across the website was to educate. In doing so, the cleaners were able to perform at a much higher satisfaction rate as customer's expectations were never inflated. By being completely transparent about the service, the cleaners could always be confident in their bond back guarantee.</p>

                  <p>A very real example of addressing this communication gap was in the redesign of the quotation form.</p>

                  <p>It's widely accepted that less form fields results in more conversions. However, after going on several cleans, I realized it was at the expense of user experience. While the site converted well, by reducing the number of form fields in the quote the cleaners didn't receive all the information they needed to perform to the best of their abilities. With this insight, the quote form was redesigned to use conditional form fields, hiding and showing extra inputs only if the user showed any interest.</p>
